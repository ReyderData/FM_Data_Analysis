# FM_Data_Analysis
Processing Football Manager data with Python to analyse potential signings or your current squad

The last update was the attributes file where I filter the scouted shortlist and through the players attributes.
I create different scores per role with the correspondent key attributes for each one.
Right now, itÂ´s a messy file with prints, on the upcoming days will be updated with functions.
The aim is to create a tiny app to do the pertinent scout with an interface.
